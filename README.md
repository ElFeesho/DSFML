DSFML
=====
DSFML is a static binding of SFML, which let's you use SFML in your D programs. DSFML attempts to be as compatible with SFML, but does so in a way that makes sense for the D language, such as using new features only D has, and avoiding raw pointers.

The code found here is the beta version for the new DSFML.


Use [DSFML-C](https://github.com/Jebbs/DSFML-C) along with this branch to get everything working.

Unit Tests
===
Unit tests are currently being written for the binding. Feel free to attempt to build and run them, but they will use assets you most likely won't have on your system. Once the tests are finished a switch will be added to the build script for easy building and running.
