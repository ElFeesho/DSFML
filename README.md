DSFML
=====
DSFML is a static binding of SFML, which let's you use SFML in your D programs. DSFML attempts to be as compatible with SFML as possible, but does so in a way that makes sense for the D language.



Getting Started
===
Check out the wiki for information on [getting started](https://github.com/Jebbs/DSFML/wiki#getting-started) with DSFML.


Nightlies
===
DSFML uses a C wrapper for SFML in order to run, called DSFML-C. There are tutorials in the wiki for building this from source, but if you would rather download these nightly* builds, feel free.

[Windows 32bit](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/167365084/DSFML%20for%20Windows.zip) - Compiled December 19th, 2013

Windows 64bit - Coming 2014(Unless someone else wants to build them for me)

[Linux 64bit](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/167365084/DSFML%20for%20Linux.zip) - Compiled December 19th, 2013 on Mint

OSX - Coming 2014(Unless someone else wants to build them for me)

*Nightly builds are not actually built every night. Only when there have been changed.

Unit Tests
===
Unit tests are currently being written for the binding. Feel free to attempt to build and run them, but they will use assets you most likely won't have on your system. Once the tests are finished a switch will be added to the build script for easy building and running.
